Rules:

Upon joining a match, both users will have their ships randomly placed on the board for them.
A person will be randomly selected to go first. Upon the user's turn, they will be asked to pick a
coordinate on the map to launch artillery at. After confirming the selection, it will be announced
if the attack was a hit or miss. The goal is to sink all of the opponent's ships. A winner is decided
when one person has lost all of their ships.
